* If you extend an existing, explained application, make the new code
  as close as possible to the old one. When you make changes, make
  sure you have good pedagogical arguments in the report.
  For a student, the extension in your code should just be the *necessary*
  extensions required to use the bootstrap design, or the *natural* extensions
  that follows from more functionality in the new tool (like a navbar).
* There was a clear idea of splitting the view.html file into a generic
  part and a problem-dependent part. If you deviate from this, provide
  arguments, e.g., that you cannot have a generic form part
  (seems that it is generic to me). Also, the result part should have
  exactly the same design unless you are forced to deviate (now the plots
  are below each other).
* The compute function now returns tuple of 2- or 3-tuples. I found that
  less readable than four parameters, so provide good arguments why this
  is an enhancement. The code is still problem-dependent. An extension
  towards a more generic return data structure would be a list of
  dicts, where each dict could be the name of a parameter, its value,
  its graph, etc. Then the receiving code (the results part of the template)
  could set up its own table and be more generic. But then you need to
  utilize that idea.
* Why use view.py when the original code has the name controller.py and
  that is the convention in the documentation? Students easily get confused
  by that...
* The navbar is fine, but unmotivated as it stands now because of the
  unmotivated testFunc thing. A better solution is to say you can import
  several compute functions and list them all in the navbar.

from compute import compute_vib, compute_gamma
compute = [('Vibration_problem', compute_vib), ('Gamma_density', compute_gamma)]

@app.route('/' + compute[0][0], methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@app.route('/' + compute[1][0], methods=['GET', 'POST'])
# Would be ideal of the lines above could be automated...
def index():
  # Make completely generic navbar for any given compute list

* Explain the getForm construction in detail. It's new!
* Why do you run eval on text? Again, you may extend functionality
  here, but motivate and explain. I tried to test and understand,
  but didn't get what you mean in the if arg_names part.

Maybe make one version close to vib3 and another app where you use
extended ideas, but make motivated differences.
